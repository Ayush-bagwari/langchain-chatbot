About us:
During the ‘National Conference of Chief Secretaries’ held on 15-17 June 2022, Hon’ble Prime Minister emphasized a creation of ‘Dashboard for cities’ so as to compare themselves against other cities in their State as well as across the country.
Accordingly, AAINA – Dashboard for cities, an initiative of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is being envisaged which would serve as a tool for comparing similarly placed ULBs and promoting peer learning amongst ULBs. This dashboard will inspire the ULBs by pointing to possibilities and areas of improvement and providing them the opportunity to learn and engage with frontrunners.
The dashboard will provide information on status and progress of the cities on five broad thematic areas viz. Political and Administrative Structure, Finance, Planning, Citizen Centric Governance and Delivery of Basic Services. The proposed list of indicators being captured across these thematic areas are:-
Political and Administrative
Finance
Planning
Citizen Centric Governance
Delivery of Basic Services
